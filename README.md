to practice core cybersecurity skills. This includes scanning and enumerating open ports, analyzing Windows services, exploring SMB configurations, \> 
and performing legal password hash extraction and cracking within a controlled two-machine setup.

### Skills Learned

- Building a two-machine cyber lab using VMware
- Configuring a Windows host with exposed services for testing
- Preparing user accounts and settings for future password auditing
- Establishing NAT-based network isolation between VMs
- Setting up a Linux system with essential security tools for scanning

### Tools Used

- VMware Workstation for virtualiztion
